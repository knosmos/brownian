&lt;p&gt;After analysing my situation in great detail and considering all possible courses of action, I came to the conclusion that I was screwed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was assigned a month ago, but the human mind is a master at refusing to get things done. At first I had decided that two weeks would be enough to finish it, but as the time ticked down I convinced myself that two days would be sufficient. Reality only kicked in the night before the 8:00 a.m. deadline, when I realised that I had yet to start. As it turns out, inertia not only applies to physical objects, but also to our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what to do? The project was worth twenty percent of the final grade. If I didn’t at least try... well, considering my current track record, let’s just say that I would’ve been in for a hell of a hard time. So I got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, my dear friend, is how I found myself at two in the morning, eating a bowl of Cup Noodles brewed with cold coffee. It’s not as bad as it sounds. Well, it actually is about as bad as it sounds, but the dorm’s kettle was broken and taste buds are a lot more forgiving when you’re desperate for something to eat ― hence why I decided that at this time and place it was socially acceptable for me to mix instant noodles with the cup of coffee left on the kitchenette counter from two (or was it three?) days ago. I was probably committing some sort of culinary war crime in the process, but I was far beyond caring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he says. Glancing wearily at the time marked on the hands of his pocketwatch, he tumbles gracelessly out of his cramped apartment bed. The work doesn’t pay well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/em&gt; is a photograph of Earth, taken from a distance of six billion kilometers by the Voyager spacecraft. Described by Carl Sagan as “a mote of dust in a sunbeam,” our home planet barely takes up a pixel of the vast inky seas beyond. We think we have conquered Nature herself as we bend ecosystems to our will; we think we are masters of the laws of physics as we build spires that graze the sky. We have sailed the seven seas, we have summited the highest peaks, and we have mapped the farthest islands. But as that photograph shows, there is so much of the heavens we have yet to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a cognitive limit, a remnant of the good old days when humans spent their lives foraging for berries and lived in small nomadic bands of at most a hundred people Hunter-gatherers never needed to comprehend the phrases “I found 2,140,201 pounds of blackberries this year” or “the tribe population increased to 1,200,305 inhabitants in the spring season.”&lt;/p&gt;
