The reeds grow<br>
so thick and tall<br>
as they stand stiff<br>

in the oppressive breeze<br>
that you canâ€™t see<br>
which way is left and<br>

which way is right<br>
as the muck slushes<br>
sickeningly below<br>

you feel it seeping<br>
into your boots<br>
as it laps at your feet<br>

a cloud of mosquitoes drone about<br>
the sun beats down from above<br>
and yet<br>

You press on.<br>
