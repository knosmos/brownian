quarks, leptons, bosons ―<br>
we are all<br>
the same<br>
inside
<!--TEASER_END-->

life is a river<br>
sometimes it is sparkling and smooth<br>
sometimes it is murky and turbulent<br>
always it flows onward

try sitting<br>
on the mountaintops<br>
with naught<br>
but the company<br>
of stars

under the same brilliant<br>
iridescent skies<br>
there are<br>
no strangers

when you’re feeling down<br>
remember that the worst<br>
day of your life<br>
still hasn’t happened

the tempests<br>
rain devastation<br>
but also bring<br>
the water of vitality

someone<br>
out there<br>
wants to be<br>
the person<br>
you try to hide

these words<br>
were not written<br>
by an algorithm<br>
but do they feel<br>
any more<br>
human?

wood fire crackles<br>
let the smell of fresh pine<br>
warm your hands<br>
but don’t burn yourself

sometimes<br>
we care too much about<br>
our tomorrow<br>
and not enough about<br>
our today

poetry doesn’t<br>
have to be good<br>
to be poetry ―<br>
it just has to<br>
be real.
