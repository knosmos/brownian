the last night with my two suitcases   
sprawled across the living room floor   
their intestines spilling out in   
the darkness i looked down the   
hall one more time   
to see your Picasso-   
angled limbs, your head   
faceplanted in a pillow with the   
room lights still on and   

when i see the last photo   
of you on my camera roll   
you’re standing pretending   
to take a business call   
with your hair looking like   
it’s been through both a  
Van de Graaf and a washing   
machine and   

i know i was never the   
best at showing you   
how to program or how   
to write or how to love   
a sister but i’d like   
to think that i showed you   
a little about how to find   
joy in stupid things and   

i know you’ll change   
and grow and blossom but i   
hope through it all you   
never forget to take   
your daily ration   
of absurdity
