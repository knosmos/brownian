Death is rudely awoken by a phone call.

“Fine,” he says. Glancing wearily at the forsaken time marked on the hands of his pocketwatch, he tumbles gracelessly out of his cramped apartment bed. The work doesn’t pay well.
<!-- TEASER_END -->
He rubs his eyes. His withered hands flail clumsily around the nightstand as he gropes for his glasses, knocking over his dentures, and brushing against his cup of evening coffee. A realization, too late. The sharp yet gentle *plink* of ceramic shrapnel.

Death sighs. His skeletal feet stir irregularly as he gingerly avoids the spot of brown now slowly spreading across the carpet. With his glasses now balancing precariously on the bridge of his bony nose, Death shuffles in the darkness towards his closet. There is a ketchup stain on his cloak, but he ran out of laundry detergent. Trailing his cloak behind him, he snatches his scythe from its perch on the coatrack. The air is cool and dry, the streets deserted. The sky is a black canvas dotted with sparkling pinpricks. Death moves silently like a rippling shadow, his robes flowing, his blade glimmering gently as he glides through the moonlight.

*Samantha. Age twenty-five. Pneumonia. 1123 Pisano Lane.*

Where is that again?

It’s been too many thousands of years. Death feels his memory slowly melt into the darkness of the night. Death stops and fumbles for his cellphone. Fate isn’t responding to his increasingly annoyed texts. With no other choice, he wanders from door to door, looking for the right address, growing increasingly frustrated.

Death curses Fate under his breath. He imagines her sleeping on a four-poster bed while her servant is sent scurrying around town like a scythe-wielding squirrel, trying to find people at three in the morning. He thinks about his wife, who, unsatisfied with him being home infrequently, left for another man. He thinks about his parents, so long gone their voices are but faint echoes in his mind.

His thoughts are broken by a droplet of rain. It cascades from the sky, first a trickle and then a downpour, drenching his cloak, making it cling to his bony frame. Miserable and cold, Death looks for something, *anything*, to hold over his head, but only manages to find a piece of discarded newspaper. He hides under the sheet as he trudges through the flooded streets. It is terribly ineffective.

Finally, Death finds the right house. Twice he nearly trips over his own robes as he makes his way across the garden. He creeps up the wooden steps, the stairs shifting and creaking underneath.

There is a sickly coughing from within. With a sigh of relief he reaches into his pockets, only to realize he forgot his lockpicks. He knocks, pounds on the door, rings the doorbell, jiggles the handle, shouts, makes menacing gestures, and tries to cut it open with his scythe to no avail. He peers through the window, but the curtains are drawn shut. He looks at the chimney, but it is too high for him to climb. Exhausted, he slumps against the wall.

Death decides he’ll deal with it in the morning.
