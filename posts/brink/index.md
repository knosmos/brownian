on the granite Killian sculpture  
iâ€™m standing on the brink  
of tears  

you hold my hand against  
the stone as if to keep me  
from falling  

into spirals of missed deadlines and  
failed exams and broken code  
and unraveling friendships  

because i can feel them drifting  
away like dying leaves  
in autumn, cold as the winter  
wind on the terrace  

where i sit down wishing  
that life were solid  
like the concrete beneath  
and not inching ever-closer  
to the brink
