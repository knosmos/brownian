Taiwan, I hear you singing —<br>
your wind from mountain<br>
to sea, your skyscrapers<br>
and rolling fields of rice, your air<br>
of incense and motorcycle fumes,<br>
your 7-Elevens and blistering sun<br>

Taiwan, I hear you singing —<br>
there’ve been too many<br>
summers we’ve spent apart<br>
but though we’ve changed<br>
so much since we last met<br>
still<br>
you feel<br>
like home
