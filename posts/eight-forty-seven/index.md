at eight forty seven<br>
my phone pings with a<br>
picture of a stuffed dinosaur,<br>
the wordless acknowledgement<br>
of my presence in your heart<br>
and your presence in mine

<!--TEASER_END-->

i look upwards at deep solid<br>
blues fragmented interrupted<br>
by leaves wondering<br>
if you’ve done the same today<br>

do the branches look the same so far away?

i used to hold on to you<br>
your cold fingers interwoven<br>
nestled against mine<br>

i used to sketch with you<br>
scribbles and patterns, watercolor<br>
animals and shutterstock cliffs<br>

i used to sit with you<br>
comfortably silent together<br>
on the Uni steps to admire the view<br>

do you miss those mundane moments too?

soon we’ll just be memories in each others’ minds<br>
but even as we continue<br>
our paths parallel six hours<br>
apart i hope a year from now<br>
my phone will ping with a<br>
picture of a stuffed dinosaur<br>
and i will smile<br>

and hopefully<br>
you will too
