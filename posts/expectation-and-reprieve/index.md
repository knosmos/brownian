even when you try it’s never enough;<br>
the hailing winds of words that echo through<br>
the house, condemning every move, every<br>
breath; storms of expectation relentlessly<br>
screaming, trembling walls with tempest each hour.
<!--TEASER_END-->
even when you cry it’s never enough;<br>
be a man, they say; silence the voice that<br>
gnaws away at the back of your mind, hide<br>
inside the tortoise-shell society<br>
demands; dam the rivers, let rage devour.

even when you fly it’s never enough;<br>
there’s always someone faster, smarter, and<br>
always someone whose pentameter is<br>
more iambic, always someone who can<br>
write or rhyme far beyond your own power.

and so you leave cacophony behind<br>
and walk alone to speak with nature’s song;<br>
through wind’s wan whistle in forest branches<br>
the river’s ripples beckon, shimmering<br>
in moon’s bright silver light as water’s edge

wraps around your ankles ―<br>
and as the sky darkens<br>
to black you feel<br>
for the first<br>
time truly<br>
free.
