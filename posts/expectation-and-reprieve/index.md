hailing winds of words reverberate through<br>
the house, condemning every move, every<br>
breath ― storms of expectation relentlessly<br>
screaming, trembling walls with tempest each hour.<br>
<!--TEASER_END-->
be a man, they say; silence the voice that<br>
gnaws away at the back of your mind, hide<br>
inside the tortoise-shell society<br>
demands; dam the rivers, let rage devour.<br>

but even concrete crumbles and fractures;<br>
the facade of contentedness breaks <br>
under the rising tide of emotion,<br>
the slings and arrows of manmade fortune.<br>

so you walked alone to speak with nature’s song;<br>
through wind’s wan whistle in forest branches<br>
the river’s ripples beckon, shimmering<br>
in bright silver light as water’s edge,<br>

wrap around your ankles ―<br>
and as the sky darkens<br>
to black you feel<br>
for the first<br>
time truly<br>
free.
