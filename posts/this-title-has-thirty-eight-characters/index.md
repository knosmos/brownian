 The text contains four hundred fifty five characters and sixty seven words; it also has one semicolon. It is self-referential. There are forty two “t” characters in this text. It is introspective but serves no purpose, simultaneously detail-oriented and metaphysical, straying from practicality, only functioning to describe itself. Fundamentally, why do we seek to write such pointless self-referential texts? Such a question I leave to the philosophers.
